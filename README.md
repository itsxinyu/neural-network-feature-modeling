# Neural-Network-Feature-Modeling
Interpretable neural network modeling with feature-driven inputs (SHAP &amp; LIME) in python

### Overview
This project applies neural-network-based feature modeling to option market data (SPX options) to predict changes in implied volatility, with a focus on model interpretability using SHAP and LIME.

### Key Techniques
- Feature engineering on structured and time-series data
- Neural network modeling (TensorFlow / Keras)
- Model evaluation and diagnostics
- Model interpretability using SHAP and LIME

### Example Application
As an example use case, this project applies neural network models to option market data (SPX options) to predict changes in implied volatility based on inputs such as returns, maturity, and delta. The same modeling framework can be applied to operational, cost, and performance analytics problems.

### Notes
The dataset used in this repository is for demonstration purposes only and has been anonymized or sampled.
